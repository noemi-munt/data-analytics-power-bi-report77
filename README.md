## üìä Data Sources & Model
**Imported Tables:**  
- `Orders` is imported from an Azure SQL Database
- `Stores` is imported from an Azure Blob Storage
- `Products` and `Customers` are imported from local csv files

**Data Transformation:** 
  - Remove sensitive client information such as card numbers from the `Orders` table
  - Create a `Full Name` column in the `Customers` table by combining `[First Name]` and `[Last Name]` 
  - Ensure all regions are correctly and consistently spelled in `Stores[Region]`
  - Removed null/empty/duplicate records  
  - Deleted unnecessary columns  
  - Ensured consistent naming conventions  

**Data Model:**  
- Built a **star schema** to optimise query performance and maintainability.  
- Summary of relationships:  
  - `Products[product_code]` ‚Üí `Orders[product_code]`  
  - `Stores[store_code]` ‚Üí `Orders[Store Code]`  
  - `Customers[User UUID]` ‚Üí `Orders[User ID]`  
  - `Date[date]` ‚Üí `Orders[Order Date]`  
  - `Date[date]` ‚Üí `Orders[Shipping Date]`

## üìÖ Creating the Date Table  
To generate a date table, the following DAX expression was used:  
```DAX
Date Table =
CALENDAR(
    MIN(Orders[Order Date]),
    MAX(Orders[Order Date])
)
```
This generates a column of dates from the first to most recent order date. The following DAX expressions were used to created the calculated columns.

```DAX
Day of Week = FORMAT('Date Table'[Date], "dddd")
```

```DAX
Month Number = MONTH('Date Table'[Date])
```

```DAX
Month Name = FORMAT('Date Table'[Date], "mmmm")
```

```DAX
Quarter = "Q" & ROUNDUP(MONTH('Date Table'[Date]) / 3, 0)
```

```DAX
Year = YEAR('Date Table'[Date])
```

```DAX
Start of Year = STARTOFYEAR('Date Table'[Date])
```

```DAX
Start of Quarter = STARTOFQUARTER('Date Table'[Date])
```

```DAX
Start of Month = STARTOFMONTH('Date Table'[Date])
```

```DAX
Start of Week = 'Date Table'[Date] - WEEKDAY('Date Table'[Date], 2) + 1
```

Mark the table as the Date Table and ensure the active relationship between the Order table and Date table is between `Date Table[Date]` and `Orders[Order Date]`. This allows for date-based aggregations and time intelligence calculations.

## üìà Key Measures & Calculations  
### Core KPIs  
- **Total Orders** 
  ```DAX
  Total Orders = COUNTROWS(Orders)
  ```
- **Total Revenue**  
  ```DAX
  Total Revenue = SUMX(
      Orders,
      Orders[Product Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Sale Price])
  )
  ```
- **Total Profit**  
  ```DAX
  Total Profit = SUMX(
      Orders,
      Orders[Product Quantity] * (RELATED(Products[Sale Price]) - RELATED(Products[Cost Price]))
  )
  ```
- **Total Customers**  
  ```DAX
  Total Customers = COUNTA(Customers[User UUID])
  ```
- **Total Quantity**
  ``` DAX
  Total Quantity = SUM(Orders[Product Quantity])
  ```

- **Profit YTD**: Calculates the total profit earned from the beginning of the current year
  ``` DAX
  Profit YTD = TOTALYTD (
    SUMX (Orders,
      Orders[Product Quantity] * (RELATED(Products[Sale Price]) - RELATED(Products[Cost Price]))),
      Orders[Order Date] 
  )
  ```
- **Revenue YTD**: Calculates the total revenue earned from the beginning of the current year
  ``` DAX
  Revenue YTD = TOTALYTD(
      SUMX(
      Orders,
      Orders[Product Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Sale Price])
      ),
      Orders[Order Date]
  )
  ```

### üåç Creating Date & Geography Hierarchies  
To improve filtering and visualisation, hierarchies were created:  
- **Date hierarchy**  
  - `Start of Year` ‚Üí `Start of Quarter` ‚Üí `Start of Month` ‚Üí `Start of Week` ‚Üí `Date`
- **Geography hierarchy**  
  - `Region` ‚Üí `Country` ‚Üí `Country Region`

To calculate the `Country` column the `Country Code` column was converted to the country's full name.
#### DAX for Country Column  
```DAX
Country = 
IF( 
    Stores[Country Code] = "GB", "Great Britain",
    IF(Stores[Country Code] = "DE", "Germany", "United States")
)
```
To calculate the `Geography` column the store's region was concatenated to the store's country. 
#### DAX for Geography Column  
```DAX
Geography = CONCATENATE(
    Stores[Country Region], 
    CONCATENATE(", ", Stores[Country])
)
```

#### Slicer Toolbar

Slicers allow users to filter report pages, but multiple slicers can clutter the layout. To resolve this, a pop-out toolbar is created using Power BI's bookmarks feature. This toolbar can be accessed via a navigation bar button and hidden when not in use.

To implement the toolbar: 
1. Create a slicer panel
1. Add a filter button which opens the slicer panel
1. Add two slicers in "Vertical List" style
    1. `Products[Category]` (with "multi-select" enabled)
    1. `Stores[Country]` (with "Select All" enabled)
1. Group the slicers, toolbar shape, and back button
1. Open the Bookmarks pane and create:
    1. Slicer Bar Closed (with toolbar hidden)
    1. Slicer Bar Open (with toolbar visible)
1. Uncheck "Data" to prevent bookmarks from affecting slicer selections.
1. In the Format pane, enable Action for:
    1. The "Filter button" (assign to "Slicer Bar Open" bookmark)
    1. The "Back button" (assign to "Slicer Bar Closed" bookmark)

1. **Total Staff Count (UK)** ‚Äì How many staff are employed across all UK stores?  
2. **Highest Revenue Month (2022)** ‚Äì Which month had the highest revenue in 2022?  
3. **Top-Performing Store Type (Germany, 2022)** ‚Äì Which German store type generated the highest revenue in 2022?  
4. **Sales Summary by Store Type** ‚Äì Create a summary table where:
