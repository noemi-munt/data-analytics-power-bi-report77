# Data Analytics - Power BI Report

## 1. Gather the Data
The Customers, Orders, Products, and Stores tables were imported from various sources including Azure Blob Storage and Azure SQL Database. The tables were cleaned by removing null/ empty records, deleting unnnecesary columns, and ensuring consistent naming conventions.

## 2. Create the Date Table
Created the date table using the following DAX expression 
``` DAX 
Date Table =
CALENDAR(
    MIN(Orders[Order Date]),
    MAX(Orders[Order Date])
)
```
This creates the date table from the first to the most recent order.

## 3. Build the Star Schema Data Model

Summary of relationships:
- Products[product_code] to Orders[product_code]
- Stores[store code] to Orders[Store Code]
- Customers[User UUID] to Orders[User ID]
- Date[date] to Orders[Order Date]
- Date[date] to Orders[Shipping Date]

## 4. Create Key Measures
Total Orders 
``` DAX
Total Orders = COUNTROWS(Orders)
```

Total Revenue
``` DAX
Total Revenue = SUMX(
    Orders,
    Orders[Product Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Sale Price])
)
```
Total Profit 
``` DAX
Total Profit = SUMX(
    Orders,
    Orders[Product Quantity] * (RELATED(Products[Sale Price]) - RELATED(Products[Cost Price]))
    )

```
Total Customers
``` DAX
Total Customers = COUNTA(Customers[User UUID])
```

Total Quantity: counts the number of items sold in the Orders table
``` DAX
Total Quantity = SUM(Orders[Product Quantity])
```

Profit YTD: calculates the total profit for the current year
``` DAX
Profit YTD = TOTALYTD (
    SUMX (Orders,
    Orders[Product Quantity] * (RELATED(Products[Sale Price]) - RELATED(Products[Cost Price]))),
    Orders[Order Date] 
)
```
Revenue YTD: calculates the total revenue for the current year
``` DAX
Revenue YTD = TOTALYTD(
    SUMX(
    Orders,
    Orders[Product Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Sale Price])
    ),
    Orders[Order Date]
)
```

## 5. Create Date & Geography Hierarchies
I created hierarchies to help filter and visualise data later on. To create a geography hierarchy, two new calculated columns in the Stores table called Country and Geography were added.

The Country column was calculated by using the country code. 
``` DAX 
Country = 
IF( 
    Stores[Country Code] = "GB", 
    "Great Britain",
    IF(
        Stores[Country Code] = "DE", 
        "Germany",
        "United States"
    )
)
```
The Geography was created by concatenating the country name and region.

``` DAX
Geography = CONCATENATE(
    Stores[Country Region], 
    CONCATENATE(", ", Stores[Country])
)
```

## 6. Create the Customer Summary Page
The customer summary page includes the following visualisations

- A donut chart of the total customers of each country
- A donut chart of the number of customers who purchased each product category
- A line chart of the total customers over time
- A table of the top 20 customers by revenue
- A set of three cards of the top customer by revenue, including their name, total number of orders placed, and the total revenue generated by the customer.

## 7. Create an Executive Summary Page
The Executive Summary page includes the following visuals: 
- Cards to display the Total Revenue, Total Orders and Total Profit measures
- A line chart of the revenue over time, setup in the same way as the line chart from the Customer Detail page.
- Donut charts of the Total Revenue by Country and Total Revenue by Store Type
- A bar chart of the Total Orders by the Product Category
- 3 KPIs of the  Quarterly Revenue, Orders and Profit.

### Create KPI visuals

To create KPIs for Quarterly Revenue, Orders and Profit I created a set of new measures for the quarterly targets.
- Previous Quarter Profit
- Previous Quarter Revenue
- Previous Quarter Orders
- Targets, equal to 5% growth in each measure compared to the previous quarter

To calculate the previous quarter, I used the `DATEADD` function as I encountered filtering issues with `PREVIOUSQUARTER` function.
``` DAX 
Previous Quarter Orders =
CALCULATE([Total Orders], DATEADD('Date Table'[Date], -1, QUARTER))
```
The create the target measures, I used the following DAX expression.
``` DAX
Target Orders = [Previous Quarter Orders] * 1.05
```
To set up a new KPI for the orders:

- The Value field should be Total Orders
- The Trend Axis should be Start of Quarter
- The Target should be Target Orders
The same process was used to calculate the KPIs for Quarterly Revenue and Profit.
